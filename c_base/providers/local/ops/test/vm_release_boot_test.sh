# vm_release_boot_test.sh - vm_release.sh's boot-script path against a fake `aws`
# and `curl` (no AWS, no network), in a throwaway git clone that contains main:
#
#   --restart: uploads this tree's boot script as vm/cbase-vm-boot-<sha12> (the
#   body is exactly what boot_assemble builds), points /cbase-vm/release/boot at
#   it, THEN sends the stub over SSM (the same text as the user-data), and after
#   the checks pass prunes the boot objects older than the new one and the one it
#   replaced; a failed boot prunes nothing; no serve object is ever deleted.
#   BIN (a release): the same boot steps happen before the instance is touched.
#
# Mutation checks (change made, test red on the named assertion, restored):
# prune_boot's call deleted from --restart -> "the oldest boot object is pruned";
# point_boot deleted -> "the boot pointer names the new key"; the put-object of the
# boot script deleted -> "the boot script is uploaded"; point_boot moved after
# restart -> "the boot pointer moves before the stub runs"; the prune's pointer
# readback guard removed (the `elif [ "$live_boot" != "$boot_key" ]` branch) -> "a
# moved pointer says why" (the prune library refuses a live key the listing lacks as
# well, so the nothing-deleted outcome has two owners); the failed-boot guard cannot be mutated here (the
# fake fails every SSM call, so verify fails the release anyway).
