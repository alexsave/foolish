# vm_boot_stub_test.sh - the user-data stub (vm_boot_stub.sh, built by
# vm_boot_lib.sh's stub_build exactly as vm_deploy.sh and vm_release.sh build it)
# run against a fake curl and a temp root. No AWS calls, no network.
#
# Covered: the built size and the size refusal; the stub reads the pinned
# parameter, fetches that key with a SigV4-signed request, checks the sha256 and
# the syntax BEFORE replacing anything, keeps the previous copy, and runs the new
# one; every failed check (bad sha256, a script that does not parse, the SSM read
# failing) leaves the installed copy untouched, leaves no .new behind and does not
# run anything; and boot_assemble splices the unit in.
#
# Mutation checks (each change made to vm_boot_stub.sh in turn, the test red on
# the assertion named, then restored): the sha256sum line deleted -> "a wrong
# sha256 aborts"; the bash -n line deleted -> "a script that does not parse
# leaves the installed copy"; the cp .prev line deleted -> "the previous copy is
# kept"; the trap deleted -> "a failed check leaves no .new"; the ssm request
# signed for s3 -> "a good run exits 0"; the mv deleted -> "the new script is
# installed"; the exec deleted -> "the new script ran"; the chmod deleted -> "the
# installed script is executable by root only".
