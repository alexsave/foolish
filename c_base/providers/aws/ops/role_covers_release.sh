# role_covers_release.sh [SCRIPT] [github_oidc.yaml]: the GitHub deploy role
# grants every AWS call the CI deploy makes.
#
# The role is least privilege, so a call the script gains and the role lacks
# fails the deploy on main, after every test passed, with production still on
# the old binary. This reads each `aws <service> <command>` in SCRIPT
# (providers/local/ops/vm_release.sh and the libraries it sources,
# c_base/ops/s3_prune_lib.sh and providers/local/ops/vm_boot_lib.sh, by default) and requires the IAM action
# it needs in the role. A command this table does not know stops the check: add
# its action here and to the role.
#
# The actions are not the whole grant: the role scopes them to the release
# parameters and the object-key prefixes. So every SSM parameter name
# (cbase-vm/release/<name>) and every object-key prefix (vm/cbase-<name>-) the
# scripts mention must also appear in the role, or a new pointer or key family
# would pass the actions and still fail the deploy on main with AccessDenied.
