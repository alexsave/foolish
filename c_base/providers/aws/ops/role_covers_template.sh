# role_covers_template.sh [template.yaml] [github_oidc.yaml]: the GitHub deploy
# role can apply a code deploy to the stack. The template is the app's, as the
# build writes it (dist/<app>/aws/template.yaml, providers/aws/provider.mk),
# which is what deploy.sh deploys.
#
# lambda_deploy.sh updates the cbase stack's CodeKey on its previous template,
# and CloudFormation applies that update with the role's credentials: it
# re-resolves the GetAtt of every resource the update touches, each a read of
# that resource's service as the role. One such read missing fails the update
# and rolls it back (2026-10-18: IotAuthorizer.Arn needed iot:DescribeAuthorizer
# and iot:ListTagsForResource, and no server code shipped until both were granted). So every resource type the
# template reads an attribute of must have its read action in the role. A type
# this table does not know stops the check: add its read here and to the role.
