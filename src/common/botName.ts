// "bot vs human" from a stored replay code alone the name itself must carry the
// signal. Bots are named with a reserved leading prefix that humans are forbidden
// from using (enforced client-side here and, authoritatively, by a BEFORE
// INSERT/UPDATE trigger on auth.users; see supabase/seed.sql). This reserves the
// whole namespace, so future/unreleased bots are covered with no per-name list.
//
// The prefix is a single-byte ASCII char ('%') — names are stored UTF-8 in the
// game_snapshots.extras blob, so a 1-byte prefix beats a 4-byte emoji on every
// bot seat of every stored game. '%' has no case, so it survives the signup
// uppercase-normalization unchanged.

// "must not start with it" — there is no legitimate human use of it, and this
// closes any impersonation/confusion path).
