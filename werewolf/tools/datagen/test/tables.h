// datagen's genericity fixtures. Nothing here is the string table: these exist
// to hold the tool to the general case - "a C static table of literals" - so
// that the day a second caller wants an integer lookup table or a plain ordered
// list, the tool already does it and this file already proves it.
//
// Each table below is a case the tool must get right:
//
//   DG_GRID     two dimensions, both designated, ROWS WRITTEN OUT OF ORDER and
//               cells written out of order inside them. This is the case that
//               catches a positional reader: a visitor that counts children
//               instead of reading designators produces a complete, plausible,
//               wrong table here and nowhere else.
//   DG_HOLES    a row that skips slots, and a row nobody wrote at all. Neither
//               may become an empty string; both are left out.
//   DG_ORDINAL  no designators anywhere - C's own "the next slot" rule. An
//               ordered lookup table is a table too.
//   DG_SCORE    integers, not strings, and one written as a constant expression
//               rather than a literal token, because the values come from
//               clang's evaluator and not from the source text.
//   DG_MIXED    UTF-8 and right-to-left, plus every character the emitters have
//               to escape. If a byte survives C -> TS -> Swift it survives here.
