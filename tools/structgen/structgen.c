// structgen - C structs -> TypeScript accessors over wasm32 linear memory, and
// Swift value snapshots over the same struct in native memory.
//
// libclang parses the headers for ONE target under ONE build's layout flags;
// every offset, size, bitfield position and array stride comes from clang,
// never from this tool. Run it once per build (layouts differ between builds).
// It writes one TS module of accessors and computes that layout's hash, which
// the build passes to the C side (-DSG_LAYOUT_HASH=...) so a module can prove at
// load time which layout it was compiled with.
//
//   structgen --cwd DIR --header H... --root T... --build NAME=FLAGS
//             [--target TRIPLE] [--fields T=f1,f2,SIZE]... [--const PREFIX]...
//             [--snapshot T]... [--count T.f=c]... [--writer T]... [--snapshot-only]
//             [--ts OUT] [--swift OUT] [--hash-ts OUT] [--print-hash]
//
// --ts OUT        the accessors (no hash: a host that only checks the hash must
//                 not have to import the accessors, which read the raw struct)
// --swift OUT     the same --snapshot readers (and --writer writers) as Swift
//                 value types over a POINTER TO THE C STRUCT ITSELF. See the
//                 Swift section at the end of this comment.
// --hash-ts OUT   a module holding only `export const LAYOUT_HASH = 0x...;`
// --print-hash    the same hash on stdout
// --target TRIPLE the target libclang parses for; wasm32 by default. A host that
//                 links the C natively (iOS) reads the layout ITS compiler makes,
//                 so its run passes its own triple and its own caps.
//
// --fields T=...  emit (and follow) only these fields of record T; a field that
//                 does not exist is an error. SIZE requests T_SIZE.
// --const PREFIX  emit every enum constant and object-like integer #define whose
//                 name starts with PREFIX; a prefix that matches nothing is an error.
//
// --snapshot T    emit `interface T_Snap` and `readT(m, p): T_Snap`, which copies the
//                 record out of wasm memory into a plain object that holds no
//                 pointer into it (so it outlives the memory's next write), and the
//                 same for every record T reaches. Fields are named in camelCase;
//                 nested records become objects, arrays become arrays, char[N]
//                 becomes a string. The types are readonly: a snapshot is a value.
// --count T.f=c   in a snapshot, array T.f holds only its first T.c elements (a
//                 char[N] is then c bytes of UTF-8 rather than NUL-terminated). The
//                 count field itself is not copied (it is the array's length), and
//                 a count outside 0..N throws a RangeError rather than reading past
//                 the array.
// --writer T      emit `writeT(m, p, s)`, the inverse of readT: it writes a T_Snap back
//                 into wasm memory, and the same for every record T reaches, so the
//                 kernel can read a value the host holds (a board the host changed).
//                 T must be a --snapshot. An array writes its count from its length and
//                 a string its UTF-8 bytes; a value that does not fit - more elements
//                 than the array holds, more bytes than the string, an uncounted array
//                 of the wrong length - throws a RangeError rather than truncate.
// --snapshot-only the module holds the snapshot readers and the constants, not the
//                 per-field accessors.
//
// Pointers are read, never written. In wasm32 a pointer is a u32 offset into
// linear memory, so following one means reading that u32 and using it as the
// pointee's `p`. The TS never produces a pointer C will dereference.
//   accessors     `T *f` emits T_f_at (the address of the pointer itself) and
//                 X_f_ptr(m, p): the address it holds, 0 for NULL. When T is a
//                 record or a scalar, also X_f_deref_at(m, p, i): the address of
//                 element i, after checking the pointer is not NULL and element i
//                 lies inside wasm memory (a RangeError otherwise). void *, a
//                 function pointer, an incomplete type or a pointer to a pointer
//                 get the address getter only. There is never a setter, and a
//                 record only a pointer reaches gets its accessors like any other.
//   --snapshot    a pointer field is refused unless it has --count X.f=c; with
//                 one, the snapshot follows it and copies c elements (a char
//                 pointee becomes c bytes of UTF-8). NULL with a nonzero count, or
//                 elements past the end of memory, throw a RangeError; NULL with a
//                 count of 0 is an empty array.
//   --writer      a record that reaches a pointer field is refused.
//   layout hash   a pointer field hashes as a pointer, with its pointee's size and
//                 kind, and a record pointee's own fields (a cycle back to a record
//                 on the path hashes as how far back it points).
//
// ---- the Swift emitter (--swift) --------------------------------------------
//
// Same model, same counts, same refusals; a different host. A Swift host LINKS
// the kernel, so there is no linear memory to index into and no `Mem`: a reader
// takes the address of the C struct itself (`UnsafeRawPointer`) and copies the
// record out of it into a `Sendable` value type, so nothing Swift holds points
// into storage the kernel writes next. That is the same rule as the TS snapshots
// and as the resident-slot discipline the iOS app already keeps.
//
//   --swift implies --snapshot-only: there are no per-field accessors, because a
//   host that wants a field of a struct it can address wants the struct.
//   `T_Snap` is `struct TSnap: Sendable, Equatable`, `readT(p)` builds one, and
//   `writeT(p, s)` writes one back. Both THROW rather than read or write out of
//   range: a count outside 0..N, a NULL pointer with a count, a string or an
//   array too long for its field. A refusal names the field and the value, which
//   is what a returned nil cannot do, and the call sites are few.
//   Integers widen to Int (Int64/UInt64 at 8 bytes), floats to Double, a
//   `char[N]` to String, exactly as the TS side widens to number/bigint/string.
//   A field named after a Swift keyword is emitted in backticks.
//   The module carries `SG_LAYOUT_HASH`, this run's layout hash: a host compares
//   it with the hash the LIBRARY was stamped with, so a stale binding and a
//   stale library are a startup refusal instead of a wrong offset.
//
// A LOAD IS ALIGNED BY CONSTRUCTION, which is why the readers use `load` and not
// `loadUnaligned`: every address they read is a field of a C struct at the
// address C gave it, so it already satisfies that field's alignment.
//
// ---- the parts --------------------------------------------------------------

// request, the traversal, an emitter per output - plus the two helpers that
// belong to no one emitter because both of them use them (camel and the
// collision check). The rest of the plumbing, shared with tools/datagen, is in
// tools/sgcommon.
