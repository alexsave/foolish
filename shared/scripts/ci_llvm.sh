# CI: install the LLVM this repo's C tooling needs, and export it for the job.
#
# Two things in this repo are libclang programs or wasm32 links, and both are
# part of an ordinary build rather than something a human remembers to run:
#
#   tools/structgen        reads C struct layouts through libclang and writes
#                          the modules sdk/, src/, server/ and e2e/ import
#                          (tools/structgen/gen.sh)
#   c/Makefile wasm-*      compiles the kernel for wasm32
#                          (scripts/wasm_build.sh)
#
# So a lane that type-checks, tests, builds the web or deploys the functions
# needs this, not only a lane that builds a module.
#
# ONE TOOLCHAIN, AND IT IS PINNED - clang 22 from apt.llvm.org plus binaryen 130
# from its GitHub release. It used to be Ubuntu's own clang 18 with apt's
# binaryen, and raising it is the price of the wasm modules becoming build
# outputs instead of committed files.
#
# WHY THE PIN MATTERS NOW, when it did not before. While the three .wasm.gz were
# committed, whatever clang this script installed only ever built the throwaway
# TEST module, so its version was free. Now a lane builds the bytes a visitor
# DOWNLOADS, and the version is a kilobyte and a half. Measured on one tree,
# c/build/bots.wasm and sdk/ts/wasm/bots.wasm.gz:
#
#   clang 22.1.8 + binaryen 130   191,485 B raw   the pin
#   clang 22.1.8 + binaryen 108   191,729 B raw   +244 B
#   clang 18.1.3 + binaryen 108   194,997 B raw   +3,512 B, ~+1,706 B gzipped
#
# AND THE PIN IS WHAT MAKES THE MODULE REPRODUCIBLE, which is the property the
# committed-artifact arrangement assumed was unobtainable. With clang 22.1.8 and
# binaryen 130, c/build/bots.wasm comes out byte-identical on macOS arm64
# (Homebrew), Linux arm64 and Linux x86_64 (apt.llvm.org, and x86_64 is what
# ubuntu-latest runs) - all md5 ac53b4dc5484aabad381d2d7bc451088, 191,485 B. The
# same holds for oracle.wasm and oracle-mt.wasm. scripts/wasm_build.sh --check
# is the gate that keeps it true.
#
# WHY ONE SCRIPT AND NOT TWO. The obvious shape was to leave this at clang 18
# for libclang and add a second script pinning 22 for the wasm build. Both
# export WASM_CC - tools/structgen/gen.sh reads it as "the libclang to generate
# with" and c/Makefile reads it as "the compiler to target wasm32 with" - so two
# scripts writing one variable means the LAST step to run decides which clang
# built the shipped module, silently, for 1.7 KB of download. That is the exact
# class of drift this whole change is removing, so there is one script.
#
# Nothing is lost by generating with 22 instead of 18: the generated TEXT is
# measured byte-identical across Homebrew clang 22.1.8, apt.llvm.org clang
# 22.1.8 and Ubuntu's clang 18.1.3, and the layout hash is independent of the
# libclang version by construction (shared/tools/structgen/test/hash.sh).
# .github/workflows/wasm.yml has pinned 22 from apt.llvm.org for the structgen
# job since before this, for the same reason.
#
# apt.llvm.org IS reachable from this project's environments - verified from the
# owner's Mac (HTTP 200) and from inside clean ubuntu:24.04 containers on both
# arm64 and x86_64, where llvm.sh installs 22 and the modules build.
#
# Explicit LLVM paths, not `clang`: the swift:6.2.4-noble image already has
# Swift's own clang at /usr/bin/clang, and plain ubuntu-latest has gcc as cc.
#
# Idempotent: safe to run again in a job that has already run it, and safe to
# run after scripts/ci_bots_test_wasm.sh.
#
# EVERY DOWNLOAD IS PINNED BY SHA-256, because what this script fetches runs as
# root in the job that builds the shipped wasm. llvm.sh comes from an immutable
# commit of its source repository (apt.llvm.org serves the same script from
# there, and its copy changes without notice); the packages it then installs
# are GPG-verified by apt. The binaryen tarballs are checked against the
# hashes the release publishes. Raising a pin is: fetch, hash, edit below.
#
#   ci_llvm.sh --verify-downloads   fetch and verify every pinned download
#                                   into a temporary directory, install
#                                   nothing (runs on a Mac too)
