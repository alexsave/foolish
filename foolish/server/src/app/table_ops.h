// table_ops.h - one game operation per request: load, run the kernel, commit
// with a compare-and-swap, push.
//
// The port of the TypeScript server's table_io.ts (runTableOp, commitProducts,
// ratingsFor) and server_table.ts, both deleted since, onto the C kernel called
// directly (foolish/c/src/table.h).
// There is no resident table: each request loads the row, runs ONE kernel
// section on per-thread scratch (a Game and TableSnaps, about 84 KB), and
// commits the products with store game_commit at expected_version = the
// version it loaded. A lost CAS reloads and re-runs, up to CB_TABLE_ATTEMPTS
// (5, as MAX_ATTEMPTS was). A warm process may cache the rows it just
// committed (game_cache.ts: PLAYING games only, 256 entries); a stale entry
// costs one CAS conflict, and a refusal computed from the cache is re-checked
// on a fresh read before it is answered (freshOnly).
//
// THE KERNEL SECTION, in order (server_table.ts names in brackets):
//   table_init, table_load(state, roster) [load], table_set_deal_seed(hex of
//   the 32-byte seed, lowercase, exactly as table_io.ts's bareHex wrote it)
//   [setDealSeed], the operation, table_commit_products [commit]; when the
//   products say wants_ratings: store ratings_for over the seats, table_rate,
//   table_commit_products again (the products are const: no re-run is needed
//   in C, unlike the wasm host); then copy out every envelope and cast the
//   fan-out needs before the scratch is reused.
// Every kernel call takes now_ms from cb_now_ms(); the kernel never reads a
// clock, a socket, a JWT or the store.
//
// AFTER A WINNING COMMIT (all before the response, as today):
//   * fan-out (fanout.h): every commit casts, whatever it moved;
//   * finalize when products.ended: table_replay_code + table_replay_extras
//     into store snapshot_put, then the next commit clears logs (finalize.ts);
//     a failure is logged and swallowed, as today;
//   * TABLE_EMPTY deletes the game (store game_delete at the new version) and
//     answers no envelope (out->envelope NULL): there is no board left;
//   * needs_bots: cb_bots_kick(ctx, id).
