// lib_faultstore.h - a store that fails one chosen call, for the error paths.
//
// fs_wrap(inner) is a cb_store whose every operation forwards to `inner`
// (which it closes with itself), except the one fs_fail_at picked: the
// k-th store call from now (on any thread) answers `rc` instead and is not
// forwarded. A sweep fails k = 0, 1, 2, ... until a run makes no failure
// (fs_failed() false), the way unit_oom.c sweeps allocations.
//
// Its ops->name is "fault", so code that asks which backend it has
// (the console's SQL, the import's counts) sees neither.
